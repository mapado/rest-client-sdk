# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

* [MIGHT BREAK] the identifier attribute (`@Rest\Id`) is mandatory to call `ClassMetadata::getIdentifierAttribute()`
  It previously defaulted to `id`. It was more to avoid BC break in Mapado codebase more than a real feature.
  It now throws an instance of [MissingIdentifierException](https://github.com/mapado/rest-client-sdk/blob/v0.30.0/src/Exception/MissingIdentifierException.php)
  This way is is less magic and more understandable.
* [MIGHT BREAK] Throw a lot more exception than before in different case that should not really happen (like calling `getMetadata` with a wrong model name for example).
